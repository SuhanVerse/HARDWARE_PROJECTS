## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to **HARDWARE_PROJECTS**, a personal collection of microcontroller-based experiments and builds by **SuhanVerse**.  
These projects explore how to connect and control hardware like **touch sensors**, **OLED displays**, **LEDs**, and **motors** using **Arduino** and **ESP32** boards.

Each project is designed to be:
- Easy to understand and reproduce  
- Modular and expandable  
- Focused on real-time interaction and visual feedback  
- Documented for learning and sharing

## 🚀 Current & Upcoming Projects

### 🔹 ESP32_OLED_TOUCH
> OLED animation with touch-triggered messages using ESP32 DevKit V1  
- Uses `millis()` for smooth animation  
- Auto-adjusts text size  
- Timeout returns to animation mode

### 🔹 GALIJ_OLED
> Simple OLED text display using Arduino UNO  
- Touch sensor cycles through hardcoded messages  
- No animation or auto-sizing

### 🔹 OLED_TOUCH
> Touch sensor triggers message display on OLED  
- Modular sketch  
- Easy to extend with animation or debounce

### 🔹 Touch sensor interface
> Basic input test with LED feedback  
- Ideal for beginners  
- Can be expanded to control other modules
